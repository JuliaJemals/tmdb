## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
As a dedicated movie and TV show nerd myself, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of patterns within some of the most popular movies globally. Can we identify certain metrics that will make a movie an almost guaranteed success? What role does gender or the genres play? During times of peak movie franchises, how do prequels or sequels of a movie factor into the overall success? I am to answer these questions with this project.

## File Description <a name="description"></a>
This projects includes one Jupyter notebook with all code required for analyzing the data and creating a supervised machine learning algorithm. The csv file train.csv contains 3,000 movies with 22 variables as the training data set for the algorithm. The csv file test.csv contains the test data with 4,398 movies and 22 variables.

## Results
The main findings of the analysis have been published will be published in a blog post on Medium. Currently, this project is still in develeopment and there are no final results for now.
